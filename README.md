This is a project that I did as a part of Data and applications course. This includes 4 phases. 
* Phase 1 :  The requirements document that describes what the database has to store and what functionalities it provides. 
* Phase 2 :  An ER diagram based on the SRS (Made an ER diagram of other team that has been alotted)*
* Phase 3 :  Improved ER model, Relational model, 1NFs, 2NFs, 3NFs and some example tuples for each final relation.
* Phase 4 :  Implementing the data schema in MySQL and functions through PyMySQL(python3) or MySQLdb (python2).
